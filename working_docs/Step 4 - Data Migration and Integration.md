- **Data Sensitivity:**
  - Some data may be sensitive or subject to regulatory compliance.

### **4.2.2 Choose Migration Strategies**

**Options:**

1. **Online Data Transfer:**
   - Use network-based transfer methods.
2. **Offline Data Transfer:**
   - Use physical devices for data transfer.

**Recommendations:**

- **Hybrid Approach:**
  - For smaller, critical datasets, use online transfer.
  - For large volumes of data, use AWS Snowball Edge appliances.

**Services Used:**

- **AWS Direct Connect:**
  - Establish a dedicated network connection between BPC's data center and AWS for secure, high-bandwidth transfer.
- **AWS Snowball Edge:**
  - Physical devices provided by AWS to securely transfer large amounts of data.

### **4.2.3 Develop Migration Plan**

**Steps:**

1. **Set Up AWS Environment:**
   - Configure AWS accounts, IAM roles, and security policies.
   - Establish AWS Direct Connect or order AWS Snowball Edge devices.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Clean and validate data before migration.
   - Encrypt data if required.

3. **Data Transfer Execution:**
   - **For Online Transfer:**
     - Use **AWS DataSync** to automate data movement.
   - **For Offline Transfer:**
     - Load data onto Snowball devices and ship to AWS.

4. **Data Validation Post-Migration:**
   - Verify data integrity using checksums or hashes.
   - Compare source and target datasets.

5. **Data Synchronization:**
   - For datasets that change during migration, plan incremental syncs to capture updates.

6. **Cutover Planning:**
   - Schedule the final switch-over to the new system.
   - Communicate timelines to stakeholders.

**Timeline Estimates:**

- **Data Transfer Duration:**
